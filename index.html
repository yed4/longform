        <p>This was our very first project in this course. Using source code given by the professor we had to edit html files to make a website that served as an introduction of ourselves. We covered our majors, interest, and what we hoped to get out of this class.</p>

        <p>In this project we were asked to design three logos that represented a personal brand or image. We used various different programs like Canvas Logo Maker and Adobe Express.  There was a multitude of fonts, layouts colors, and shapes available to create the most representing logos of ourselves.</p>

           <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
              <p>Rhetoric, technology, and ethics are integral to acts of making. Rhetoric shapes how people convey their intentions and messages, enhancing a creation's impact. Technology provides the tools and methods to bring ideas to life, expanding creative possibilities. It's extremely fascinating to see how far we've come with innovations, like 3D printing,  which can often blur the lines between physical and digital creation. When thinking about ethics it requires creators to assess their impact on society, the environment, and individuals. Learning the skills in a class like this may seem futile to some people but the information provided has the ability to change people’s lives especially in this digital age we live in today.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
            <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
              <p>Learning about the various principles that make good design, such as contrast, color, typography, has been essential to my journey and work output in this class. Being able to fully understand these concepts and utilize them has been a fun process of trial and error. I am excited to learn about more concepts and see how they shape my future projects in this class.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
             <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
              <p>Being able to have the time in class to cooperate, help and learn from one another is extremely beneficial and necessary I would say for this course. Looking at other people’s work and having them give feedback on my own work allows me to get tan idea of how other people think and what influences their creative output. This helps me look inward and discern what affects my creative mind and how I can improve on different aspects.</p>

              <p> Having had the opportunity to utilize various different design tools and platforms allowed e to learn an array of skills. The most important is utilizing the right softwares to maximize the outcome of the design or object one is trying to make. Making sure that files and documents are in the appropriate format and compatible with different tools is also something I had to learn the hard way. However once mastered and in unison, these platforms can help one create whatever their heart and minds desire.</p>

              <p><em>5. Learn to present your work.</em></p>
              <p>So far the various projects we have been faced with have most definitely helped be able to present my work to an audience better, using different means of communication. The best example would be during our UX Testing phase when we had to find a way to showcase the logo designs to the interviewees and ask them very specific questions to be able to improve on our logos with the given feedback.</p>

           <p>As the semester concludes, the discussion spans the acquisition of skills like UX testing. Essential to acts of making are rhetoric, technology, and ethics. Rhetoric shapes how intentions are expressed, enhancing a creation's impact. Technology provides tools, expanding creative possibilities. Ethical considerations prompt creators to assess their societal, environmental, and individual impact. Despite skepticism about the relevance of such skills, the knowledge gained in courses like this has the potential to significantly influence lives, especially in today's digital age.</p>

Delving into an array of design principles—contrast, balance, emphasis, proportion, hierarchy, repetition, rhythm, pattern, white space, movement, variety, and unity—has significantly shaped my educational experience and creative endeavors in this class. Mastering the nuanced application of these elements, from leveraging contrast for impact to incorporating white space for clarity, has been a dynamic process of discovery and refinement. The interplay of hierarchy, repetition, rhythm, and pattern adds depth and coherence to my designs, while elements like movement, variety, and unity contribute to their overall dynamism and cohesion.

Reviewing the work of peers and receiving constructive feedback on my own projects provides valuable insights into diverse perspectives and influences on creative output. This collaborative exchange not only fosters a sense of community but also prompts introspection, helping me understand the factors influencing my creative process and offering opportunities for improvement in various aspects.
